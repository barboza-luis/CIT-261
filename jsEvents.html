            <p>HTML DOM events allow JavaScript to register different event handlers on elements in an HTML document.</p>
            <p>Events are normally used in combination with functions, and the function will not be executed before the event occurs (such as when a user clicks a button).</p>
            <p>In the source code you can see the diverse events, there are mouse events, keyboard, touch screens among others. The test objects are the button, textbox and image.</p>
